# Maniacal Labs PiPixel

The PiPixel provides simplified hookup of digital LED strips to the Raspberry Pi family of single board computers. It uses the standard Pi "HAT" form-factor to provide two easy power input options, and data output of the SPI port as well as GPIO 18 and 13 (used for WS2812), along with built-in voltage level shifting to keep your LED strips happy being connected to the 3.3V Pi.
